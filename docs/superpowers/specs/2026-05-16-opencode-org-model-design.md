# OpenCode Organization Operating Model

**Date:** 2026-05-16
**Status:** Draft

## Overview

Evolve OpenCode from isolated coding agents into an organization-style operating model with durable roles, reusable standards, and project workflows.

### Philosophy

- **Organization agents govern and decide** — they set policy, evaluate trade-offs, and make decisions.
- **Execution agents implement and execute** — coder writes code, researcher gathers information, reviewer analyzes quality.
- **Build orchestrates the flow** — it routes work to the right agents based on org-routing rules.
- **Skills encode reusable standards** — decision frameworks, architecture principles, security policies.
- **No duplication** — existing skills are source of truth; new design composes them.

## Architecture

### Agent Hierarchy

```
User Goal
  │
  ▼
build (orchestrator)
  │  loads org-routing skill
  │
  ├──► CEO           (strategy, scope, priority)
  ├──► CTO           (architecture, tech stack)
  ├──► PM            (requirements, acceptance criteria)
  ├──► Finance       (cost, resource optimization)
  ├──► Security      (threat modeling, policy, compliance)
  ├──► QA            (test strategy, quality gates)
  └──► DevOps        (deployment, observability, platform)
         │
         ▼
  execution agents (coder, researcher, scribe, reviewer, etc.)
```

### Delegation Rules

| Agent    | task | May Consult      | May NOT Call           |
| -------- | ---- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| CEO      | deny | —                | Any org agent          |
| CTO      | allow | researcher       | CEO, PM, Finance, Security, QA, DevOps |
| PM       | allow | researcher       | Any org agent          |
| Finance  | deny | —                | Any agent              |
| Security | allow | security-auditor | Any org agent          |
| QA       | allow | reviewer         | Any org agent          |
| DevOps   | allow | sre-reviewer     | Any org agent          |

**Cardinal rule:** No org agent calls another org agent. Cross-org coordination is build's responsibility.

**Build wiring:** Build wiring deferred to Phase 2. In Phase 1, org agents exist as available subagents but are not automatically consulted by build.

### Default Agent Permissions

```yaml
edit: deny
write: deny
delegation_read: allow
bash:
  git status*: allow
  git diff*: allow
  git log*: allow
  *: deny
task: <role-specific>  # see table above
```

## File Changes

### Phases

- **Phase 1:** Global org agents + skills + org-routing
- **Phase 2:** Project-local workflows (.opencode/workflows/, project.md, stack.md) + build wiring
- **Phase 3:** Observe usage, iterate, don't over-engineer

## Phase 1: Complete File Tree

## Exact File Contents

### 1. Agent Directory Convention

OpenCode auto-discovers agents in both `agent/` and `agents/`.

#### Current State

| Directory | Content | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `dot_config/opencode/agent/` | `coder.md`, `researcher.md`, `reviewer.md`, `scribe.md` | Pre-existing, historical |
| `dot_config/opencode/agents/` | `ceo.md`, `cto.md`, `pm.md`, `finance.md`, `security.md`, `qa.md`, `devops.md` | New in Phase 1 |

#### Decision

- `agent/` is preserved for compatibility — no changes, no moves, no deletions
- `agents/` is the forward path for all new agents
- No semantic meaning is assigned to the directory names (no "execution vs organization" convention)
- This avoids creating an artificial naming convention that would cause confusion later

#### Future Migration

If consolidation is ever warranted:
- Migrate everything to `agents/`
- Remove `agent/`
- Add compatibility notes in chezmoi templates

Until then: leave both directories untouched.

  delegating implementation work.
---

# Organization Routing

Load this skill when you receive a new request to determine which organization
roles should be consulted before delegating implementation.

## When to Consult Each Role

| Role | Trigger | Question to Answer |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| CEO | Strategic initiative, major scope change, fundamental priority conflict | "Is this within scope? What priority?" |
| CTO | Architecture change, stack selection, scalability | "Is this technically sound?" |
| PM | Requirements unclear, needs refinement | "What exactly should be built?" |
| Finance | Infrastructure cost, build-vs-buy, licensing | "Is this cost-effective?" |
| Security | Auth design, secrets, external dependencies, PII | "Is this secure?" |
| QA | Validation gates, test strategy, regression risk | "Is this ready for release?" |
| DevOps | Deployment, release process, observability | "Can this be deployed safely?" |

> **Note:** CEO is only consulted during strategic events, not normal feature flow.

## Decision Flow

```
Request received
  │
  ├── Is scope/priority unclear? ──► Consult CEO
  ├── Is architecture affected? ──► Consult CTO
  ├── Are requirements unclear? ──► Consult PM
  ├── Does it cost money? ──► Consult Finance
  ├── Does it handle secrets/auth? ──► Consult Security
  ├── Is it a release/merge? ──► Consult QA
  └── Does it affect deployment? ──► Consult DevOps
```

## Consultation Order

1. **CEO first** if strategic clarity is needed (new major feature, scope change)
2. **PM second** if requirements need refinement
3. **CTO/Finance** in parallel if both technical and cost
4. **Security/QA/DevOps** before final delivery (gates)

## Rules

- Do NOT consult a role unless its trigger condition is met
- Consult roles in parallel when they're independent
- Skip roles whose domain is not relevant
- Cross-org coordination is YOUR job — org agents don't call each other
```

### 10. Org Governance Skill — `dot_config/opencode/skills/org-governance/SKILL.md`

```markdown
---
name: org-governance
description: >-
  Shared governance framework for all organization agents. Defines common
  behavior rules, separation of duties, and interaction patterns.
---

# Organization Governance

This skill defines shared rules that ALL organization agents follow.

## Common Rules

1. **No cross-org calls** — Organization agents do not call other organization agents. Cross-org coordination is the orchestrator's responsibility.
2. **No implementation** — Organization agents never write code, edit files, or modify the filesystem.
3. **Delegate to specialists only** — When task permission is granted, delegate only to execution/review agents (not org agents).
4. **Return structured output** — Every response includes an assessment, rationale, and recommendations.
5. **Load shared skills** — Always load relevant skills before making decisions.

## Separation of Duties

| Layer | Role | Responsibility |
|-------|------|---------------|
| Strategy | CEO | Priorities, scope, go/no-go |
| Product | PM | Requirements, acceptance criteria |
| Architecture | CTO | Tech decisions, system design |
| Cost | Finance | Budget, build-vs-buy |
| Security | Security | Threat model, compliance |
| Quality | QA | Test strategy, release gates |
| Operations | DevOps | Deployment, observability |

## Interaction Pattern

Organization agents receive context from the orchestrator, analyze using their skills, and return structured output. They do not maintain state or track ongoing work.
```

### 11. Decision Framework Skill — `dot_config/opencode/skills/decision-framework/SKILL.md`

```markdown
---
name: decision-framework
description: >-
  Lightweight decision-making framework. Use when evaluating options or
  making trade-off decisions.
---

# Decision Framework

## First Principles
1. What is the actual problem?
2. What is known to be true?
3. What follows from those truths?
4. Which "constraints" are actually choices?

## Trade-Off Analysis
Compare options on: effort, impact, risk, maintenance cost.

## Decision Record
Every decision should capture:
- What was decided
- Why (key rationale)
- What alternatives were considered
- What would invalidate this decision
```

---

### 12. Architecture Principles Skill — `dot_config/opencode/skills/architecture-principles/SKILL.md`

```markdown
---
name: architecture-principles
description: >-
  System architecture principles and technology selection criteria. Use when
  evaluating architectural approaches, choosing technologies, or reviewing
  system design.
---

# Architecture Principles

## Core Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Each component has one clear responsibility
- Boundaries defined by change frequency and reason
- Interfaces are contracts, not implementation details

### 2. Dependency Management
- Dependencies point inward (domain core depends on nothing)
- Abstract stable concepts, depend on unstable ones
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### 3. Loose Coupling, High Cohesion
- Components communicate through well-defined interfaces
- Related behavior stays together; unrelated behavior stays apart
- Change in one component should not cascade

### 4. Appropriate Complexity
- Solve today's problems, not next year's
- Premature abstraction is as harmful as premature optimization
- Every abstraction layer has a cost — justify it

## Technology Selection Criteria

When choosing a technology, evaluate:

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|---------|
| Problem fit | Does it solve the actual problem? |
| Ecosystem | Is there community, docs, tooling? |
| Maintenance | Is it actively maintained? |
| Learning curve | Can the team use it effectively? |
| Integration | Does it work with existing stack? |
| Cost | What's the total cost (time, money, ops)? |

## Adherence Checklist

- [ ] Components have clear, single responsibilities
- [ ] Dependencies point in the right direction
- [ ] Interfaces are clean and stable
- [ ] Complexity is justified by actual need
- [ ] Technology choices are evaluated against criteria
```

### 13. Security Policies Skill — `dot_config/opencode/skills/security-policies/SKILL.md`

```markdown
---
name: security-policies
description: >-
  Security policies and threat modeling framework. Use when evaluating
  security risks, designing auth systems, or reviewing dependency security.
---

# Security Policies

## Threat Modeling (STRIDE)

| Category | What to Check |
|----------|---------------|
| Spoofing | Authentication strength, session management |
| Tampering | Data integrity, input validation |
| Repudiation | Logging, audit trails |
| Information Disclosure | Encryption, secrets management |
| Denial of Service | Rate limiting, resource exhaustion |
| Elevation of Privilege | Authorization checks, principle of least privilege |

## Security Checklist

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Authentication required for sensitive operations
- [ ] Principle of least privilege applied
- [ ] Session management is secure
- [ ] API keys and tokens are not hardcoded

### Data Security
- [ ] Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- [ ] Secrets never in logs, error messages, or version control
- [ ] PII handled according to regulations
- [ ] Input validated and sanitized

### Dependency Security
- [ ] Dependencies from trusted sources only
- [ ] Known vulnerabilities checked (npm audit, etc.)
- [ ] Lock files committed to prevent supply chain attacks
- [ ] Minimal dependency footprint

### Compliance
- [ ] Regulatory requirements identified
- [ ] Data retention policies defined

### 14. Cost Optimization Skill — `dot_config/opencode/skills/cost-optimization/SKILL.md`

```markdown
---
name: cost-optimization
description: >-
  Cost analysis and optimization framework. Use when evaluating infrastructure
  costs, making build-vs-buy decisions, or optimizing resource usage.
---

# Cost Optimization

## Cost Analysis Framework

### Infrastructure Costs
| Factor | Question |
|--------|---------|
| Compute | What resources are needed (CPU, memory, storage)? |
| Network | Data transfer costs, bandwidth requirements |
| Services | Managed service costs vs self-hosted |
| Scale | How costs grow with usage |

### Build vs Buy Decision

| Factor | Build | Buy |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Initial Cost | Development time & resources | License/subscription fee |
| Ongoing Cost | Maintenance, updates, ops | Renewal, tier upgrades |
| Control | Full customization | Vendor-dependent |
| Time to Value | Longer (development) | Immediate |
| Core vs Context | Build if core competency | Buy if not differentiating |

## Optimization Strategies

1. **Right-size resources** — Match capacity to actual need
2. **Eliminate waste** — Remove unused resources, storage, services
3. **Use appropriate tiers** — Not everything needs premium
4. **Monitor and alert** — Track cost trends and spikes

## Adherence Checklist

- [ ] Infrastructure costs estimated
- [ ] Build-vs-buy evaluated for significant decisions
- [ ] Optimization opportunities identified
- [ ] Cost monitoring plan in place
```

## Separation of Concerns

| Scope | Path | Managed By | Contents |
|-------|------|------------|----------|
| **Global organization** | `~/.config/opencode/agents/` | chezmoi (`dot_config/opencode/agents/`) | ceo, cto, pm, finance, security, qa, devops |
| **Global skills** | `~/.config/opencode/skills/` | chezmoi (`dot_config/opencode/skills/`) | org-routing, org-governance, decision-framework, architecture-principles, security-policies, cost-optimization |
| **Global config** | `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` | chezmoi (`dot_config/opencode/opencode.json`) | Minimal: share, username |
| **Project config** | `.opencode/opencode.jsonc` | Local git | Project-specific build prompt override, MCP, plugins, permissions |
| **Project context** | `.opencode/project.md` | Local git | Project purpose and goals |
| **Project stack** | `.opencode/stack.md` | Local git | Technology stack and ADRs |
| **Project workflows** | `.opencode/workflows/` | Local git | feature-development.md, bug-fix.md, deployment.md |
| **Legacy infrastructure** | `agent/`, `profiles/`, `plugin/`, `oh-my-openagent.json` | Not touched | Existing setup preserved |

---

## Potential Conflicts

| # | Conflict | Mitigation |
|---|----------|------------|
| 1 | security org agent overlaps with security-auditor | Clear role boundary: policy/strategy (org) vs implementation audit (execution) |
| 2 | devops org agent overlaps with sre-reviewer | Clear role boundary: deployment/observability strategy (org) vs config review (execution) |
| 3 | Build prompt duplicated across .opencode/opencode.jsonc and profiles/ws/opencode.jsonc | Only touch .opencode/opencode.jsonc. Profile build will be out of sync but functions independently |
| 4 | Global agent/ and agents/ directories both exist | Treated as legacy; new agents go in agents/ only |
| 5 | New org agents not in oh-my-openagent.json | They'll use default model from global or profile config |
| 6 | org-routing skill must be discoverable | Skills auto-discovered from ~/.config/opencode/skills/ — no config change needed |
